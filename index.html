            <h2>All the worlds a stage</h2>
            <p>All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players               ;
               They have their exits and their entrances,
               And one man in his time plays many parts,
               His acts being seven ages.

              <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? (Sonnet 18)</h1>
               <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? <br />
               Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br />
               Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
               And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.<br />
               </p>
                 <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
                 And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br />
                 And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
                 </p>By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;<br />
                   <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
                   Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br />
                   Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,</p>
                   </p>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.<br />
                     <p>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />
                     </p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
